🚨 THE BUTTON! 🚨
Prepare yourselves for **The Button Game**
A mysterious 12-hour countdown has begun, and the fate of the world rests in your hands! ⏰
Keep the button alive and prevent the timer from reaching zero!
You only get **1 click every 3 hours**. Choose wisely!

The button color represents the remaining time:
- 🔴 Red: 0-2 hrs (Danger Zone!)
- 🟠 Orange: 2-4 hrs (Getting Risky!)
- 🟡 Yellow: 4-6 hrs (Caution Advised!)
- 🟢 Green: 6-8 hrs (Safe... For Now!)
- 🔵 Blue: 8-10 hrs (Steady Progress!)
- 🟣 Purple: 10-12 hrs (Nicely Done!)

As a reward for your bravery, you'll earn a exclusive role based on the color you click!
Use `myrank` to check your personal stats and `leaderboard` to see how you stack up against other fearless clickers! 

Do you have what it takes to keep the button alive and prevent the timer from reaching zero?
